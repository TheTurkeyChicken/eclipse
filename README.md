# Welcome to Justin's unassorted AP Computer Science work!

Whilst you're here, feel free to use my code as reference for when you are stuck, or simply to benchmark the elegance of your solution.
It is important to note that for the more lazy of you, this repository can be used as a tool of harm, rather than for the good. Don't do the former. Instead, let this be constructive in helping you think through your solutions.
If Lu ever suspects someone is doing mindless copying from this repo, I am making it private without question.

If you need help with concepts or assignments beyond simply scrolling through reference code, DM me on Discord and I will most likely help but that depends on my opinion of you.

**You will find the bulk of my work located in Notes/src**


Some disclaimers on tEcHnOlOgY uSe AnD eThIcS:

The intention of this repository is to help others think through problems by providing a single, centralized source of most problems assigned in class.
Whilst I acknowledge the risk of blatant, mindless acts of copying, it is by no means the purpose of this repository.
I made this repository to assist others with the goal of saving most of everyone's time and to provide constructive support for those who need it.
Should it be needed, public access to this repository can be revoked.
