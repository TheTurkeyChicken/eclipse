# Welcome to Justin's unassorted AP Computer Science work!

Whilst you're here, feel free to use my code as reference for when you are stuck, or simply to benchmark the elegance of your solution.
It is important to note that this repository for the more lazy of you, can be used as a tool of harm, rather than for the good. 
If Lu ever suspects someone is doing mindless copying from this repo, I am making it private without question.

Without delaying you further, please feel free to access any of the files... 

**You will find the bulk of my work located in Notes/src**
